## Install both the client side and server side by running 'npm install' in both folders

### Next, start the server by running 'npm start' in the server folder

### Now you can run the 'npm start' command in the client folder. This should open a page at http://localhost:3000 where you can specify a username and room name, and chat with anyone who joins the same room.
